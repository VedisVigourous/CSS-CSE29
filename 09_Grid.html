    <!-- Similar to flexbox but this is : 2D working (both row and column at once) 

    Uses grid line: include border line and lines inside content

    | | | | |
    | | | | |
    Ex. The above has 5 grid lines (vertial) and 2 grid tracks (spaces between lines)

    Terminologies: 
    1. grid-line
    2. grid-cell
    3. grid-area
    4. grid-track -->

    <!-- 1.grid-template-column: partitions the grid into column and element goes into row
         2.grid-template-rows: partitions the grid into rows 
         
         3. grid-area: gives a specific area to the elements 
            Types: 1. main
                   2. sidebar
                   3. footer
                   4. header 
                   
        ** But we need to define areas to the cells we made using:
        
        4. grid-template-areas: assign the area name to the cells
           Types: same as grid-area 
           
        5. gap: 
           row-gap and column-gap : gives area between the cells 
           Syntax: gap: 10px 5px - rep row and column 
           
        6. justify-items :
           1. flex-start
           2. flex-end
           3. center
           4. stretch
           5. base-line and simolarly: align-items 
           
        ** 7. place-items : combination of justfy and align items 
        
        8. justify and align-content: works on all the elements as one 
           mix of both props: place-content 
        
        **Remember: justify - main axis
                    align - cross axis -->
